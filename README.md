# Testing-Protractor
Protractor Framework

I have completed the test for the 3 tasks you have given namely for the
color, link and font using protractor framework. I am attaching the 2
files needed to run the tests. The config file is used to configure
browser (default:chrome ) and its properties. The testFacebook js file
is where I have written the 3 test cases. To run the program , we need
to install Nodejs, Xcode, selenium server and Protractor on MAC. Please
let me know if you have any queries.

To run the tests:
1. Run the selenium server using:- “webdriver-manager start” after
installing protractor
2. Use Command:-  "protractor config.js” and both the files should be
in the same path
